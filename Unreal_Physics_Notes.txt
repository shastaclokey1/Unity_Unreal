Physics Engine For Unreal

[Collisions]
    - Actors can be set to block, overlap, or ignore objects of given types.
    - For two objects to collide and bounce off eachother, they both need to have their collision settings
      set to block the other's object type.
    - Collision events for blocking and overlapping can be listened to through call backs in blueprints or c++.
    - Common actor types are WorldStatic, WorldDynamic, Pawn, PhysicsBody, Vehicle, and Destructible.
    - That's about it for collisions.

[Constraints]
    - To make swinging chandaliers, or ball and chains, or any pendulum-like objects, use a constraint joint.
    - Constraint joints refer to two objects. One object is the joint anchor and the other is the constrained body.
    - The constrained body can swing back and forth between the given max rotation angles.
    - The joint is called a physics constraint actor.
    - Seems pretty simple to me.
